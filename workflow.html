    <p>Many people place these tools in the primary theme folder of their site. However, it is often more useful to put them in the root of your website, so that both custom modules and themes can share the same workflow, coding standards, and so forth.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes installing a few modules won't cut it, and you'll need to rely on additional tools to improve your theme's output. A theme is often the source of many images, scripts, and other things that slow the frontend down.</p>
<p>Using a consistent process to make sure all of your assets are always lean is a good way to control the page weight of a site.</p>

<h3>Automation tools</h3>

<p>With these tools you will be able to capture repetitive tasks and run them automatically whenever you need them. It might be as frequent as a file save, or only once per deploy. But either way, having an automated workflow is less error-prone and more reliable than manually remembering and executing the tasks.</p>

  {% for tool in site.automation %}
