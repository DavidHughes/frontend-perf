AdvAgg is another more advanced option, when your needs have outgrown Magic's functionality.

* All of Magic's features, plus...
* Stampede protection protects your Drupal site when aggregates are re-generated.
* Prevent more than 4095 CSS selectors in an aggregate. (old IE bug)
* Pre-compress aggregates. Faster than on-demand compression.
* Configure the number of aggregates created.
* Minification of JS (not available in Drupal 7 core).
* Minify and/or inline CSS and JS.
