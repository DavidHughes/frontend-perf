Modernizr provides integration for the Modernizr JS library. Its primary performance-oriented feature is the ability to use `Modernizr.load()` to asynchronously request assets based on the feature detection it performs on each individual browser.

It also contains a Drupal API that lets you build the smallest-possible Modernizr file, so you serve less unused feature tests.
