A tool that allows you to collect trends of performance data. Unlike WPT _Speed Index_, which combined many factors into a single, digestible number, `grunt-phantomas` exposes the raw data and graphs its progress over time. It has built-in support for tests, allowing you to set a limit on any number of factors and easily spot the failing tests.
