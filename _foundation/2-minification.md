title: Minification
---

Minification is when all unimportant information is removed from a file. This typically means all whitespace and line-breaks are removed, but can also mean that JS variables are renamed to be as short as possible. Generous use of whitespace is required to maintain organized files, but the typical user never looks at your files so the whitespace is unnecessary bulk.
