Timeline has a slighly generic sounding name, but it is very important when you have rendering issues. The most common rendering issues are animation related (e.g. a menu expands in a jerky fashion instead of smoothly). The timeline describes the steps the browser took to determine the layout of your webpage and then paint it on the screen.
