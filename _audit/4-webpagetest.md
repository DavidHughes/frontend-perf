WebPageTest (WPT) is currently the most reliable method for determining the perceived performance of your website or app. It combines a large number of factors to produce a **Speed Index** which closely approximates when a user starts to see your webpage.

You can run the tests from many geographical locations, all data is easily accessible, and it can be saved.
