# Frontend Performance Training

This repo contains slides and materials to help you learn about frontend performance. From basic principles to workflow automation, you and your team can learn how to audit sites, fix problems, and stick to a performance budget throughout the life of a project.

## Learning Objectives

- **Create a foundation of knowledge** which allows you to optimize an existing site.
- **Confidently build a performant site** from scratch while balancing other priorities like feature backlogs and deadlines.
- **Use automated workflow tools** to check every change you make to a site, ensuring that major changes in performance do not go unnoticed during the development cycle.
